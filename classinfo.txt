perioic_table - periodic table of class Elements.

class Element;
init(name, small, position, molar, atomic_number, electronegativity, electrons):
creates new element with the above characteristics
get_shells
sets up shells - so 1s, 2s, 2p1 etc. found in the .shells
note: this algorithm is not very accurate as it does not take into account the shell energies.
shell_energy(n, l, m, x)
calculates the energy of a shell using Rydberg's equation. n is the shell number, l is the subshell, m is the orbital, and x is the number of electrons before this shell.
highest_energy()
uses shell_energy to calculate the highest energy shell in the atom.
out()
returns a dict of the element
valency()
calculates the number bonds that can be formed - so for carbon it is 4, nitrogen 3, etc.

class Compound
init(name, entropy, enthalpy, constituents):
entropy, enthalpy and constituents can be set to 0, 0, [] respectively. If name is blank but constituents isn't it will predict the name, and if name is set but not constituents the reverse will occur.
check_data()
uses data files deployed with chemsi to get the entropy and enthalpy data.
components()
returns a list of all element smalls contained within
find_constituents()
uses name to work out constituent atoms.
find_name()
uses constituents to find name.
mass()
returns molar mass of compound
composition()
returns dict of all atoms and the % mass they make up.
gibbs_energy(temperature)
calculates gibbs energy of a compound for a given temperature.

class Reaction()
init(temp)
sets up the reaction environment
predict()
uses my algorithm to try to predict the reaction products based on lowest energy states.
return_products()
returns a dict of all products with number - ie {"CaCO3":2}
return_reactants()
return_products only for reactants
entropy_change()
calculates entropy change of reaction
enthalpy_change()
calculates enthalpy change of reaction
gibbs_change()
works out gibbs change of a reaction
equilibrium_point()
calculates the value of ln(K) for a given reaction at the temperature of the reaction
turning_point()
calculates the point at which the gibbs energy is 0 - ie minimum temperature it will go (or max)
